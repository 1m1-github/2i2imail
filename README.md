# 2i2imail

current email systems order the inbox chronologically by default and based on text relevance when searching

imagine each email came with some currency attached

then we could present the inbox in the fairest ordering as described here: https://github.com/2i2i/whitepaper

market based inbox

each msg comes with importance attached via some coin (literally ANY coin, that is the innovation)

privacy as zero knowledge (zkp) makes it possible
