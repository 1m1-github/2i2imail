# 2i2imail

current email systems order the inbox chronologically

imagine each email came with some currency attached

then we could present the inbox in the fairest ordering as described here: https://github.com/2i2i/whitepaper

the current email systems are special use cases of 2i2i (fixed price at zero)

if a distributed computing system allowed for private messaging, this could be entirely "on-chain"
